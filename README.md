# Mealable

Modern recipe application developed with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS/SASS.

Developed with Model-View-Controller architecture with structure, maintainability, and expandability in mind. Abstracting configuration and helper files for expandable code and accessibility. Using the publisher-subscriber pattern to keep handler in the controller and listener in the view.

Concepts used: async/await for API calls, DOM manipulation using template literals
