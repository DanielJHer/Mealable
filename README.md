# Mealable

Modern recipe application developed with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS/SASS.

Developed with Model-View-Controller architecture with structure, maintainability, and expandability in mind. Abstracting configuration and helper files for expandable code and accessibility. Using the publisher-subscriber pattern to keep handler functions in the controller module and event listeners in the view module.

Concepts used: async/await for fetching API calls, OOP for manipulation and rendering of data into the DOM with Parcel, local storage manipulation.
